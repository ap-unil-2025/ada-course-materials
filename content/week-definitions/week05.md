## Week 5: Guest Lecture - Generative AI for Programming

### Guest Lecturer
**Anna Smirnova** - PhD Candidate

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the landscape of AI tools for programming (chatbots, assistants, agents)
- Distinguish between standard and reasoning AI models
- Learn effective prompt engineering techniques for code generation
- Understand the capabilities and limitations of AI-assisted programming
- Get hands-on experience with GitHub Copilot and other AI coding tools

### Topics Covered
- **The AI Landscape**: Three types of AI tools for coding
  - Chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude)
  - Code Assistants (GitHub Copilot, Cursor)
  - Autonomous Agents (Devin, Claude Code)
- **Understanding AI Models**: Standard vs. reasoning models
- **Practical Usage**: How to effectively use GitHub Copilot
- **Prompt Engineering**: Techniques for better AI assistance
- **Reality Check**: Benefits, limitations, and ethical considerations
- **The Future**: Autonomous coding agents and their implications

### Schedule
- **Guest Lecture**: Monday, October 13, 2025 (10:15 - 12:00)
- **Live Demo**: Using AI tools for programming tasks
- **Q&A Session**: Discussion about AI's role in data science

### Key Concepts
- Large Language Models (LLMs) architecture
- Transformer models and attention mechanisms
- Context windows and token limits
- Fine-tuning vs. prompt engineering
- Chain-of-thought reasoning
- AI safety and alignment

### Practical Skills
- Using GitHub Copilot effectively
- Writing effective prompts for code generation
- Debugging AI-generated code
- Understanding when to use (and not use) AI assistance
- Evaluating AI tool outputs critically

### Important Considerations
- **Academic Integrity**: Proper attribution and understanding
- **Code Quality**: AI as a tool, not a replacement for learning
- **Security**: Risks of copying AI-generated code without review
- **Bias**: Understanding limitations and biases in AI systems

### Additional Resources
- GitHub Copilot documentation
- OpenAI and Anthropic research papers
- AI safety and ethics guidelines
