# Advanced Data Analytics, HEC Lausanne, Fall Semster 2025

> **Data Scientist (n.):** *Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.*

* This is a 14-week Masterâ€™s level course on machine learning, offered at HEC Lausanne during the Fall Semester 2025 (Monday, September 15 - Monday, December 15, 2025).
* The course format consists of three 45-minute lecture sessions, followed by a 45-minute hands-on session at the end of each lecture.


### Meeting time and location

* Meeting time: Mondays, 10:15 - 12:00; 16:30 - 18:00
* Where:  Internef 126 (10:15 - 12:00); Anthropole 3185 (16:30 - 18:00)


### TA sessions:

* A weekly hands-on session is held on Mondays from 17:15 to 18:00, led by the teaching assistant, Maria Pia Lombardo.
* Individual TA sessions can be arranged via email and take place on Fridays upon request.


## Class enrollment on the [Nuvolos Cloud](https://nuvolos.cloud/)

* All lecture materials (slides, codes, and further readings) will be distributed via the [Nuvolos Cloud](https://nuvolos.cloud/).

### Video to get started with Nuvolos

* First steps on Nuvolos (Video available on Nuvolos platform)


## Course Objectives

* The objective of the course is to gain practical familiarity with current computer-aided data analysis and machine-learning approaches.

* We will study various machine learning methods in the context of:
    - supervised machine learning (classification and regression). 
    - unsupervised machine learning.
    - reinforcement learning (if time permits).

* The lectures will be interactive, in a workshop-like style, that is, a mix of theory and actively playing with code examples (delivered in Python and deployed on a cloud computing infrastructure).


## Prerequisites

* Basic econometrics.
* Basic programming in Python (see [this link](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html) for a thorough introduction).
* Basic calculus and probability ([Mathematics for Machine learning](https://mml-book.github.io/) provides a good overview of skills participants are required to be fluent in).


## Approximate schedule

Witness the incredible transformation of a student throughout the Machine Learning course, from a blank slate to a pioneer in AI!

## Grading

* Every student has to provide a **capstone project** that illustrates what was learned. 
* Each student individually has to propose a data science project and work on it over the course of the semester. 
* The due date to submit the project is in the last week of the semester.
* The deliverables are: 
    - i) a report of about 10 pages lengths. 
    - ii) a GitHub repository with the related code and data.
    - iii) a video recording of a maximum of 10 minutes length that presents the project, the findings, etc.
* We will award the grades based on whether the captstone project demonstrates an understanding of the material. **There will be no exams**.
