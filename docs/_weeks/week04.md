## Week 4: Supervised Learning - Regression

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the fundamental concepts of supervised learning
- Master linear and polynomial regression techniques
- Learn optimization methods including gradient descent
- Apply regression models to real-world datasets
- Understand model complexity and overfitting

### Topics Covered
- **Supervised Learning**: The general framework and approach
- **Linear Regression**: Single and multiple variables
- **Gradient Descent**: Optimization algorithm for model training  
- **Polynomial Regression**: Non-linear relationships
- **Tuning Model Complexity**: Bias-variance tradeoff
- **Practical Applications**: Stock market prediction (if time permits)
- **Data Manipulation**: Introduction to Pandas

### Schedule
- **Lecture**: Monday, October 6, 2025 (10:15 - 12:00)
- **Practice Session**: Monday, October 6, 2025 (16:30 - 18:00)
- **TA Session**: Discussion of exercises and finger exercises

### Key Concepts
- Cost functions and loss minimization
- Normal equation vs gradient descent
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Model evaluation metrics (MSE, MAE, RÂ²)
- Overfitting vs underfitting

### Practical Skills
- Implementing regression from scratch
- Using scikit-learn for regression tasks
- Data preprocessing with Pandas
- Model evaluation and validation

### Assignments
- **Exercise 2**: Distributed this week
- Complete finger exercises with TA guidance
- Practice implementing gradient descent
