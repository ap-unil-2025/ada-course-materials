## Week 9: Recap Week

### Overview
This week provides a comprehensive review of the most important concepts covered in the first 8 weeks of the course. It's designed to consolidate learning and prepare students for the advanced topics in the remaining weeks.

### Learning Objectives
- Consolidate understanding of fundamental machine learning concepts
- Review supervised learning approaches: regression and classification
- Revisit optimization techniques and gradient descent methods  
- Strengthen knowledge of deep learning fundamentals
- Practice with sequence modeling and neural networks

### Topics Reviewed
- **Supervised Learning - Regression**: Linear and polynomial regression recap
- **Supervised Learning - Classification**: k-NN, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees
- **Optimization Methods**: Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent
- **Deep Learning Foundations**: Feed-forward networks and backpropagation
- **Sequence Modeling**: RNNs, LSTMs, and their applications
- **Applications in NLP**: Brief introduction (self-study)

### Schedule
- **Lecture**: Monday, November 10, 2025 (10:15 - 12:00)
- **Practice Session**: Monday, November 10, 2025 (16:30 - 18:00)
- **TA Session**: Review and Q&A on previous exercises

### Recap Materials
- Comprehensive notebooks covering all major topics
- Step-by-step implementation reviews
- Problem-solving strategies and best practices
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

### Key Learning Reinforcements
